        "1. Traditional Features\n"
        "ALMS provides a set of core functionalities that are essential for effective library management:\n\n"
        " 1.1 Book Management: Librarians have the capability to add, update, delete, and view books within the system. Each book is assigned a unique serial number and "
        "includes detailed information such as title, author, subject, and quantity. The 'View Books' section presents all available books and supports both search and sort functionalities, "
        "allowing for efficient organization and retrieval of book records.\n\n"
        " 1.2 Book Issuance and Return: The system tracks the issuance and return of books, capturing important details such as the issue date, student ID, and book information. "
        "The 'Issued Book History' section maintains a comprehensive log of all transactions, including timestamps, return dates, and fines, ensuring accurate tracking of book movements.\n\n"
        " 1.3 Login System: A secure login mechanism is implemented for both admins and librarians. This feature includes password masking and supports submission via the Enter key, "
        "enhancing the security and usability of the login process.\n\n"

        "2. Search Functionality\n"
        "The search functionality is a crucial aspect of ALMS, providing users with an efficient method for locating specific books. In the 'View Books' section, users can enter "
        "keywords related to book attributes such as title, author, or subject. The search algorithm filters the displayed records based on the query, enabling librarians and users to "
        "quickly find particular books without manually browsing through the entire inventory. This feature significantly improves the system's usability by delivering quick and accurate search results, "
        "thereby enhancing overall efficiency in managing and retrieving book information.\n\n"

        "3. Sort Functionality\n"
        "The sort functionality allows users to organize book records according to various criteria. In the 'View Books' section, users can sort books by attributes such as title, author, or subject. "
        "This is facilitated through a dropdown menu or similar interface element, allowing users to select their preferred sorting criterion. Sorting helps users arrange books in a specific order, "
        "making data analysis, inventory management, and administrative tasks more manageable. This feature is particularly valuable for librarians who need to access records in a structured and organized format.\n\n"

        "4. Scroll Functionality\n"
        "The scroll functionality is implemented to enhance the user experience when dealing with extensive datasets. Sections such as 'View Books' and 'Issued Book History' include vertical and horizontal scrollbars. "
        "These scrollbars enable users to navigate through long lists of books or transaction records seamlessly. The vertical scrollbar allows for scrolling through lengthy book lists, while the horizontal scrollbar assists in navigating wide tables with numerous columns. "
        "By incorporating scrollbars, ALMS ensures that users can access all necessary information without being overwhelmed by large volumes of data, contributing to a cleaner and more organized interface.\n\n"
